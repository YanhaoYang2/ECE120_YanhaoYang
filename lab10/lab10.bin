; My name is Yanhao Yang and I did this program at 4/14/2023. The function of this program is to add up the 
; the positive value in the memory place and store the sum in Register 5.
; As an approach to the solution,I first assign R1 as the place that holds the location of the memory where the
; number is stored in, and then at the start of each loop I give the value in the memory place to R4 and set the 
; Then I made a BR code, if the value of cc, determined by the value inserted is negative, then we would ignore 
; the next line that adds the value in R4 to R5. Afterwards, we would move the R1 to the next memory location by
; adding one and decrease the Counter R2 by one. Then another BR code would determine if the R2 is zero, if
; it is zero, we would stop the program, otherwise we would move back to the beginning of the loop.
; Register table:
; R1-working as a pointer to point the location of the numbers in memory that are being analyzed.
; R2- Counter for 10 numbers
; R5- the place that stores final sum
; R4 - temporary storage place for the number that is analyzed

1110 001 000110001  ; R1 <- PC + x31      Initialize R1 to x3032, the location of the first number

0001 010 101 1 01010; R2 <- R5 + x0A      Initialize the value Counter R2 to 10
0110 100 001 000000 ; R4 <- M[R3]         Give the R4 the value that is being analyzed
