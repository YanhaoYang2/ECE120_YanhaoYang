QUESTION 1.  Read through the program lab9.bin. What do you expect the program to do? More specifically, which register will the program modify when it is run, and what will it contain when the program finishes? (You can probably figure this out merely by reading the comments provided in lab9.bin.)

ANSWER: This program will modify register 2, first it clears the value stored in register 2 to zero, and then the program adds decimal number 12 into the register 2. Therefore, in the end, the register 2 will store value 12 in decimal.


QUESTION 2.  Explain in a few sentences why the ability to step through a program (run one instruction at a time) is a very useful tool for debugging a program. Debugging is the process of finding and correcting bugs (or errors) in a program. Hint: Finding a bug is often much more difficult than correcting it.

ANSWER: Step could help us divide the entire program into small steps. In debugging process, command step could allow us to pinpoint the location of bug by running through the program step by step. If any of the outcomes of each step is problematic, the error locates at the last step we executed.
